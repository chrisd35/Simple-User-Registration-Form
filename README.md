# Simple-User-Registration-Form
Small user registration form using Spring Boot Framework and ReactJS as practice. 


The general purpose of this program is to emphasize on learning to utilize Spring Boot to develop a read-to-go web application. This is done by using Spring Boot for the backend portion to interact with a MySQL database. From there, the database is managed and interacted further upon through the use of an API platform (Postman). 


As for the frontend portion, it is added separately as it had made use of the default bootstraped template from "Create a React App". However, it was mainly preoccupied with creating an interactive home page where the user can either view, edit or delete an existing user of the system. Furthermore, there was a possibility to add a user through the navbar in which the user is prompted to respectively enter the user's info such as the name, username and email.
